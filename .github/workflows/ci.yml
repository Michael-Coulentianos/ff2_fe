# This workflow builds and pushes a Node.js application to an Azure Web App when a commit is pushed to the development branch.
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure App Service web app and configured its managed identity.
# For instructions, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity

# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Enable system-assigned managed identity for your Azure Web App.
# 2. Assign the managed identity the necessary roles (e.g., Contributor) on your Azure subscription or resource group.
# 3. Create secrets in your GitHub repository for AZURE_OBJECT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, and AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID.
